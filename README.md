# MJC-BSANA-2025-Network-Workshop
**An Introduction to Network Analysis for Byzantinists**

Network analysis allows researchers to model and visualize the connections and interactions between different entities (e.g., people, places, objects) in their research data. This online workshop will offer Byzantinists an introduction to network analysis and its use in historical disciplines, with a focus on Byzantine and medieval studies. Participants will gain an understanding of the basic concepts of network theory and explore projects employing network analysis and the choices that lay the foundation for the projects, including data modeling, methodology, and tools. During practical sessions, participants will learn how to format their own data for network analysis, create a database in Neo4j and query their data, interface their Neo4j database with other tools, and publish their network analysis.
# Course Outline
- **Monday, May 12, 10:00 am–12:00 pm (EDT): Network Analysis in Historical Disciplines with Christian Raffensperger**
  
  This session will introduce the ways in which historical disciplines use networks and network analysis broadly and consider some existing projects. This introduction will be followed by a demonstration and discussion of the [Russian Genealogical Database](https://www.gis.huri.harvard.edu/rus-genealogy). The discussion will focus on the methodology for gathering and inputting data, as well as how the data is stored and utilized for its network analysis capabilities on the web.

- **Monday, May 12, 2:00 pm–4:00 pm (EDT): Practical Session I: Data with Ryan Horne**
  
  This session will focus on network analysis, network fundamentals, and data modeling for networks. Participants will learn how to transform their data into a format and style suitable for network analysis. Linked Open Data resources, vocabularies, and ontologies that can help top guide participants through the data modeling process will be introduced.

- **Tuesday, May 13, 9:30 am–11:30 am (EDT): Network Analysis in Archaeology: Theory, Practice, and Applications (I) with Katerina Ragkou**
  
  This session will explore the theoretical underpinnings and practical applications of network analysis in archaeology, using case studies from the Eastern Mediterranean and the Peloponnese during the medieval period to illustrate its potential for revealing new insights into past societies.

- **Tuesday, May 13, 2:00 pm–4:00 pm (EDT): Practical Session II: Neo4j Basics with Ryan Horne**
  
  This session will begin by presenting an overview of the different tools and database options available for network analysis. Participants will then learn the basics of [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/product/neo4j-graph-database/) and bring their data into the Neo4j environment.

- **Wednesday, May 14, 9:30 am–11:30 am (EDT): Network Analysis in Archaeology: Theory, Practice, and Applications (II) with Katerina Ragkou**

  This practical session will demonstrate how to build a network analysis database using data from an ongoing research project. Participants will have the opportunity to discuss their own datasets and learn how to apply network analysis using [Visone](https://visone.ethz.ch/) software for data visualization and analysis.

- **Wednesday, May 14, 2:00 pm–4:00 pm (EDT): Practical Session III: Querying Your Data with Ryan Horne**
  
  During this session, participants will continue to work with their Neo4j database, with an emphasis on creating queries. Participants will learn how to do graph traversals, how to identify different communities and subsets in their data, and how to perform complex operations.

- **Thursday, May 15, 10am–12:30pm (EDT): Network Analysis and Prosopography with Zachary Chitwood**
  
  This session will demonstrate both network analysis and prosopography through the case study of the [MAMEMS (“Mount Athos in Medieval Eastern Mediterranean Society: Contextualizing the History of a Monastic Republic (ca. 850-1550)”) project](https://discover-mamems.openatlas.eu/). The project objectives include the construction of a prosopographical database containing all Mount Athos-related persons over the course of the Middle Ages. The session will treat problems of prosopography more generally and Byzantine prosopography in particular. Following this introduction, the specific challenges of creating an Athonite prosopography with source material that is unique both in its linguistic diversity (with substantial Greek, Slavonic, Georgian, and Ottoman material) and type (the largest surviving collection of commemorative lists in the premodern Orthodox world) will be discussed. The session will conclude with a live demonstration of the software [OpenAtlas](https://openatlas.eu/).

- **Thursday, May 15, 2:00 pm–4:00 pm (EDT): Practical Session IV: More Complex Operations with Ryan Horne**

  This session will continue the discussion of complex Neo4j and graph database operations, with an emphasis on spatial reasoning and analysis. It will conclude with an overview of types of software and other tools that can interface with Neo4j databases.

- **Friday, May 16, 10:00 am–12:00 pm (EDT): Network Analysis and Art History with Alexander Brey**

  This session will introduce participants to network analysis in art history through the case study of Manuscript Connections, a digital humanities project analyzing relationships among European medieval manuscripts. The discussion will focus on how Temporal Network Analysis and Similarity Metrics can reveal patterns of production, transmission, and reuse across time and space. Emphasis will be placed on the project's methods and, to a lesser extent, tools, including the use of [Cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org/) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/) for analyzing networks and calculating similarity metrics. While focused on medieval French, Flemish, and English manuscripts from an art historical perspective, the approaches presented are readily transferable.

- **Friday, May 16, 2:00 pm–4:00 pm (EDT): Practical Session V: Publishing Your Network Analysis with Ryan Horne**

  This session will focus on publishing a network analysis. Participants will discuss effective data visualization techniques for print and digital systems. Options for creating network interactions, embedding them into webpages, and using data repositories effectively will be presented.
