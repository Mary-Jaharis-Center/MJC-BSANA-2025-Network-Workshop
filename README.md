# MJC-BSANA-2025-Network-Workshop
**An Introduction to Network Analysis for Byzantinists**

Network analysis allows researchers to model and visualize the connections and interactions between different entities (e.g., people, places, objects) in their research data. This online workshop will offer Byzantinists an introduction to network analysis and its use in historical disciplines, with a focus on Byzantine and medieval studies. Participants will gain an understanding of the basic concepts of network theory and explore projects employing network analysis and the choices that lay the foundation for the projects, including data modeling, methodology, and tools. During practical sessions, participants will learn how to format their own data for network analysis, create a database in Neo4j and query their data, interface their Neo4j database with other tools, and publish their network analysis.
# Course Outline
- **Monday, May 12, 10:00 am–12:00 pm (EDT): Network Analysis in Historical Disciplines with Christian Raffensperger**
  
  This session will introduce the ways in which historical disciplines use networks and network analysis broadly and consider some existing projects. This introduction will be followed by a demonstration and discussion of the Russian Genealogical Database. The discussion will focus on the methodology for gathering and inputting data, as well as how the data is stored and utilized for its network analysis capabilities on the web.

- **Monday, May 12, 2:00 pm–4:00 pm (EDT): Practical Session I: Data with Ryan Horne**
  
  This session will focus on network analysis, network fundamentals, and data modeling for networks. Participants will learn how to transform their data into a format and style suitable for network analysis. Linked Open Data resources, vocabularies, and ontologies that can help top guide participants through the data modeling process will be introduced.
